This is a simple web scraper that uses requests and beautifulsoup to collect 
links that match given search criteria on given web pages. The collected links
are gathered into a list, which is then passed to an emailer function, which in 
turn sends an email, containing the links collected, to the addresses provided 
from the email account provided.
